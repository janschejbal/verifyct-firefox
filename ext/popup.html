  This extension collects all certificates seen and (if a log list has been downloaded) checks that any leaf certificate has at least 2 SCTs from logs in the log list.<br>
  It currently completely ignores log status (i.e. compromised logs will be trusted!).<br>
  <strong>This extension is under development and highly experimental.</strong> DO NOT USE IT unless you understand Certificate Transparency. Check the console for errors.
  SCTs provided via OCSP or TLS extensions are not supported and will be ignored. Thus, this extension may fail to verify certificates that are trusted by Chrome.
